## About Johan

A creative front-end dev who loves building out cool projects together with a team. Based in Gouda, The Netherlands, I work for a local company specialised in Microsoft services and Consulting called ShareValue, where I joined the Front-end team in June off 2018. I really love working on the look and feel part off a site or application. <br /> <br />
Besides coding I love to make music: My main instrument is Drums, but I also play piano and guitar. I love playing drums in my local church together with our worship team, and use my gift to bless others. <br /> <br />
Offline I love taking hikes and long walks. In 2020 I started, and finished the entire "Pieterpad", the longest walking path in the Netherlands. Starting from Pieterburen in the tip off Groningen, all the way to the St Pietersberg in Maastricht. Oh and by the way. I did not do that on my own; I did it together with my wife and our 4 kids.
