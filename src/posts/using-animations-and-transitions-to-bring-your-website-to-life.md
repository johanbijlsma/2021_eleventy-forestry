A couple off weeks ago, I organized a session for my colleagues at ShareValue to enlighten them with the ins & outs of transitions and animations.

## To get started

Everyone knows PowerPoint... and everyone knows the difference between a good, professional presentation and one that just does to much (a.k.a. "Death by PowerPoint"). With the latter, the presentation does nothing more than overload the viewers with texts, images and animations, that will only distract them instead off compelling them.

The reason I mention these examples? Animations used right can help you tell a story.

### Animations & Transitions

But what do I mean with Animations & Transitions? Is there a difference?

* Animation: A change in attributes of an element over time
* Transition: a change between 2 visual styles (for instance: a transition on hovering a button)
